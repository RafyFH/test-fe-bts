CORS Issue on Login
Please note that the login functionality is not fully integrated yet. There is a known issue with CORS when trying to connect to the login API. For now, to simulate login, manually add the user object to localStorage as described above.

We are actively working on resolving this issue, and an update will be provided soon.
